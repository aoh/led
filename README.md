# led

[![Build status:](https://travis-ci.org/aoh/led.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aoh/led)

Led will soon be a vi-compatible text editor. What makes led different from other vi-like 
editors, is that it's written in and extensible in a lisp, much like emacs.

Some other goals are:
 - tractable hackable implementation
 - unicode support, unlimited undo, regexps, etc
 - can be compiled with or without support for builtin lisp system
 - practical support for multiple edit buffers
 - no external dependencies

Led has been used to implement itself after roughly first week of development.
